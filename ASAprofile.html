                you would think are impossible. Besides the fact that he is an amazing swordsman, he is a very funny guy
                who doesn't always act the brightest. He will always make your day because of the silly dances and faces
                he does. He is looking for triangles that has two congruent angle pairs with a congruent side in the middle
                of those two angles. </div></H1>
